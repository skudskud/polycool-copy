# Railway Procfile - defines start commands for services
# This file is NOT used by default, Railway uses railway.json

# Each service should use its own railway.json:
# - polycool-api: railway.json (python api_only.py)
# - polycool-bot: railway.bot.json (python bot_only.py)
# - polycool-workers: railway.workers.json (python workers.py)

# If Railway ignores the .json files, manually configure in dashboard:
# Settings → Deploy → Start Command
