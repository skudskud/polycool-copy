# 📦 Archive - Old Duplicate Files

## What's Here:
This folder contains the **original duplicate files** that were moved here during the Railway deployment reorganization.

## Why Archived:
- ✅ **All working files** are now in `../py-clob-server/`
- ✅ **Railway deploys** from `py-clob-server/` directory
- ✅ **No more syncing** needed between directories

## Structure:
- **Original files**: The V2 telegram bot files
- **Backup files**: User data backups and API keys
- **Setup files**: Old requirements and setup scripts

## Safe to Delete:
These files are **safe to delete** once you confirm everything works in production, but kept here as a backup during transition.

## Active Development:
👉 **Work in**: `../py-clob-server/` (this is your main directory now)
